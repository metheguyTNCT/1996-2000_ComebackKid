You could have hoped for even more blue states showing on that screen, but you didn't have to stay all night biting your nails to grasp your victory. There hadn’t been many doubts on you winning the election, now the hopes are that that victory will also translate to a victory downballot. <br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding a man older than sliced bread to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br>Dole gave a short speech recognizing the result soon afterward. It's certain you won't see him much longer. He'd already announced his retirement from the senate, and this was the nail in the coffin for his life in public service. He may not have been the best candidate the Republicans could've thrown at you, but he certainly was one of the most honorable.<br><br>Talking to him on the phone, he sounded to be relieved to finally be able to throw it all behind him. In fact, it was quite a pleasant call. You joked that you wished you both had that kind of complicity back in Congress, he retorted that it's just how politics is done, and you didn't make it easier on yourself either. Maybe you could share a beer with him some day?<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you.

You could have hoped for even more blue states showing on that screen, but you didn't have to stay all night biting your nails to grasp your victory. There had been a few doubts on you winning the election, now the hopes are that that victory will also translate to a victory downballot. <br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding some cheesy 70's musician to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br> Salvatore Bono managed to keep quite the sunny disposition, even though he would bring the Republican party just another defeat. He's speech had something Reagan about it, if a bit less overly abrasive. There was quite some irony in his saying that he should have become an actor to win the election, but at least, he did his best. You watched his speech until it's end.<br><br>Hearing his call not 10 minute after he was out of the sight of the cameras, he felt much different. The subject rapidly turned to the question of his faith and Scientology. You didn't quite believe what he would claim but he claimed they wanted to use him to take over the levers of government for their profit and that scientology has an unreasonable amount of influence and reach inside of the federal government. You were honestly confused by what he was saying, but as you looked deeper into it, it seem like cults would become a big issue in your second term.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

This complete rejection of the kindler, gentler world they sought truly affected them. He kept his cool deliberate tone to have done all that could be to win and being bested a second time. America had called for him, and he had answered as he always will. The cries of his supporters could not go undiscussed, as he calmed the crowd by pledging full cooperaton, in order to ensure a world our children would want to live in.<br><br>Once speaking with you, you shared a little chuckle about deja vu, before you talked about the results. He said he couldn't lie that this defeat hurt even more than the first time. While he had kept his position of honor in defeat just 4 short years ago, he couldn't help but shake the feeling of having failed the country that called for him. You told him that a soldier's victory is not to win the war, but to fight for his country. "You've served this country well, Mr. President." you said.<br><br>After saying this, he paused for about 10 seconds. You could tell he needed a moment, as his long life of service and dedication to this country, all he had been working for his whole life, would be coming to an end. He asked for a break before calling some time later. You sought to see him in the future, he served his country with a devotion few other share.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration.

Not everyone had even the time to come before people where already celebrating. A sea of blue, states that Republicans thought to be their safe havens since Nixon switching back to you. Maybe it will be enough to gain some control back of Congress.

Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br>Phil’s speech was different. He always put the Moral Majority stuff front-and-center since before his nomination, but he turns it up to eleven for his concession speech, as he spoke to the covenant American have with the nation of the pilgrims, a people to bring light to all continents. You thought that had he just brought that same energy before in his campaign, he may have made it less of a wipe out.<br><br>When he talked with you, he had much of the same words. As a public servant, he spoke on how their ought to be a continuous fight for their personal well-being. That American dream in the new millennium needed to be maintained. You can’t help but feel a little angry that <i>he,</i> of all people, is the one lecturing you like this.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

Still, the mood was clear, ranging from disapointment to outright hate. He had everything to vainquish that hated president, over-promised and under-delivered. The hero of Iraq became a pariah. He would carry on his words under constant insults before finally vacating the premises.<br><br>The call was to the point, he assured you that he held no grudge in defeat and that he will continue to serve the nation and it's Commander-in-Chief faithfully. During the call, he brought something up that he'd never said in public, simply out of annoyance of hearing the word "race card." He thought all people of color had a good place to be in the nation, however there remains people that would only like to see them gone. The gap of color in the nation has not fully healed, and simple excellence won't ever satisfy those that simply refuse that you should exist. He asked you if you could make a vow, to support those in this country who don't have a voice.

He's speech had something Reagan about it, if a bit less overly abrasive. There was quite some irony in his saying that he should have become an actor to win the election, but at least, he did his best. You watched his speech until it's end, somewhat in admiration to his ability to avoid a very disappointed public ire.<br><br>Hearing his call not 10 minute after he was out of the sight of the cameras, he felt much different. The subject rapidly turned to the question of his faith and Scientology. You didn't quite believe what he would claim but he claimed they wanted to use him to take over the levers of government for their profit and that scientology has an unreasonable amount of influence and reach inside of the federal government. You were honestly confused by what he was saying, but as you looked deeper into it, it seem like cults would become a big issue in your second term.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration.

The results are really hamfisted, and like all episodes with Mayor Pat before they replaced him with Mayor Carradine, this one is a bit of a slog.<br><br>It’s a shame, because the concept is funny. Peter, angry that Steve successfully petitioned for a tax hike, declares that he’s defecting from the United States. We get some good gags about Peter going to the UN until he meets Russian Ambassador Igor Ivanov, who tells him if he wants respect he should invade a country. This is an eye rolling reference, of course, to the 1998 invasion of Georgia. But that’s not all; when Peter ‘’annexes’’ his neighbour Joe’s pool, the plot becomes all about Mayor Pat’s efforts to protect Peter from the UN and NATO.<br><br>GET IT! ISN’T IT FUNNY HOW BUCHANAN IS TREATING THIS SWIMMING POOL LIKE GEORGIA! This was dated in 1999, and looking back it’s even more dated. I don’t like American Dad much, but Family Guy got so much better when Seth got to whine about politics there and keep Family Guy about the gags.<br><br>Still, I did chuckle at the ending. Peter and Pat, on trial for warcrimes, being sentenced to a week of prison before coming back for another week of hijinks is just a perfect level of silliness.</p>`)

While the Republicans haven’t entered the White House since Pat, it’s not like the actual coalitions have actually changed. It’s still rural and upper class white voting for Reps and minorities and suburban people voting for Dems.<br><br>>>>>No one is disputing that politics are different from the 1990s.

          <p> It's all over. The man they mockingly called Specter the Spectator in this very footrace has pulled ahead, and all the hard work, effort, and progress is gone. As the hours dragged by, you soon moved from the ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock to your ironically named Presidential Suite. You really thought this morning that you had it in the bag. Your staff comes by, staggering their way into your room, to see you glued to the television screen, occasionally rubbing your tired, tired eyes with your hand. <br><br> ''Arlen Specter has won Ohio,'' you hear that little newscaster with her vocal fry say through the television speakers. It’s not official yet, the chyron still flashes 'too close to call’ in many states, but the way she says it, flat, resigned, like even she knows what’s coming, tells you everything. You stare at the screen, and in your heart, you know it’s over. <br><br> You know you let them down tonight, and that's something you're going to be forced to live with.<br><br> And you will. Quietly. With the cameras gone and the crowds dispersed, you'll sit with that weight in silence, every morning darker, every evening a little more still. The calls will stop. The invitations will slow. The world will keep moving, and you'll be left behind: a man who almost was, or the man who had it, and lost it, fair and square. <br><br> For the first time in what feels like hours, you turn to Hillary. ''You tried really, really, really hard, Bill. We all did,'' she says, moving her hand to your shaking knee. ''It won't be in vain, you know that?'' she adds. It doesn't matter. You'll be Jimmy Carter 2 in the history books. <br><br> You take a deep breath, stand up, and finally speak. ''Get Arlen on the phone,'' you bark to your staff. They try and fight it—something about you still having a chance, technically—but you've always been practical. After a few unbearable moments, you get the maverick from Pennsylvania on the phone. He sounds shocked, but warm. Almost. The soon-to-be President-elect swears to you on a first-name basis that he will need to rely on your counsel in the coming years. You try your best to verbally nod, and hang up. <br><br> ''You don't have to address them tonight,'' Hillary says, referring to the crowd of folks downstairs. You shake your head, put on your suit jacket, grab the little scribbles of a concession speech from your pocket, and make your way on stage. You thank your supporters, friends, family, and even Arlen Specter, who you describe as a ''man of decency and good honor'' -- someone your supporters shouldn't fear as President. <br><br> Soon it's over. As you leave the stage, the applause fading behind you, you can’t shake the feeling that your time in the spotlight has come to an end.<br></p>

            <p>“We can call it now, It’s 1999 and Steve is done for.” Was what most Democrats would say as they could see the businessman turned president struggle with a Congress that had turned back blue and trying to match the inescapable situation of lowering taxes while lowering the deficit.<br><br>Yet Malcom had another trick coming, while the commission on efficiency and taxation came in and out, while the end of the progressiveness of taxation on each bracket couldn’t be made entirely faced with deficit hawks, a new proposal, thought forgotten by so many and yet expressed as the best by all wings which had any knowledge in economy, the land tax would make itself known.<br><br>Inspired by Taiwan and the efficiency of its use in the global development of a country as well as it’s support by both Neo-liberal and keynesian economist, Forbes had put his hail mary on it to not just balance the budget but give a never seen before competitive advantage to America faced with a resurgent China. As a large part of property tax would be transferred into a tax on land, each landowner would be incentivized into developing that land instead of simply owning it and letting it grow in value.<br><br>Another part that SNL would love to play with is how it affected the franchising of McDonald, KFC and other fast food as their business model was suddenly made completely obsolete by a change in taxes. The images of the revenge of the small scale restaurant owners against Big Fast food which Forbes played up with may be what most people will remember of his first term, before things got bad.<br><br>In a massive turn around, 1999 would be the best year of growth the country had since before the oil crisis and that without driving inflation through the roof. Such was the gain, the deficit would be quelled enough for another round of tax credit which pretty much bought Forbes the presidency for 2000 against Gephart, the man responsible for the Democratic revolution.<br><br>As the world is now facing the terrorist threat and Forbes seems to come under fire from the resurgent neo-conservative wing led by George Bush, the 2004 RNC is certain to be quite a sight to see as many of those that voted for Forbes prefer Ron Paul to the son of the CIA director.<br></p><br></p>`)

    <p>(...)<br><br>Interviewer: Senator Obama, what do you think about talk of a "Rainbow Shift"? Saying that people, especially young people, are voting for more and more varied parties?<br><br>Obama: Well, it's a more complex question than just polls and results. I think... The issue is that every voice needs to be heard. If voices aren't heard, those voices will find a way to be heard. Those voices we hear today have tried to speak to the Democratic and Republican parties respectively, but they were silent. They didn't respond. Now, those voices speak on their own, as it's the only way they could.<br><br>Interviewer: So, you're thinking it's because the two traditional parties have tacked to the center?<br><br>Obama: That's the million dollar question. I'll say it as an American, we saw that as long as the two party system lived, it evolved and swapped planks between eachother. The Democrats went from the party of confederates to the party of civil rights to the party of "maintaining the status quo." Same with Republicans! Going from Lincoln to the Southern Strategy and now the Forbes Model. Those two parties remain in motion that will soon be 20 years old. It's not that they've moderated themselves, it's that they've refused to change, to bring anything new to the table, that's what's driving them down.<br><br>Interviewer: That does sound like a bias coming from you, Senator.<br><br>Obama: I'm not gonna deny my bias, what I also can't deny is that it's the second time the electoral college was inadequate in finding ourselves a president. It only happened once at a time were all men still had wigs and were saying it's still something normal while we had long outgrown the way we allowed only white male landowners to vote. The electoral college is just old bones that finally need to be buried.<br><br>Interviewer: You think President Sanders will be able to push through such an amendment? Even with a Democratic Vice President, it would require votes from both Libertarians and some Republicans.<br><br>Obama: I think it's the only way forward. If it's not now that we break the seal, we'd only stave off the inevitable.</p><br></p>`)

What would be Gore path to the presidency? The left hate him for being like Clinton and is already gathering around Ralph Nader, the right hate him for not being a Republican. What brought Clinton so far was that their wasn't any ability for the right to really magnetize around one goal but today, it is no longer the case.<br><br>We're not ever out of the possibility of seeing a miracle but one thing remains, people should vote their conscience more than ever.

Their have been many comparison among liberals between our president and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, mostly about the youthful vigor and the hope for a brighter future shouted to the rooftop. However, the same comparison on infidelity and character can be struck between two.<br><br>It may be a hard thing for most people to accept but the best thing that could have happened to Jack Kennedy was his assassination.

However, we won't be certain because he was taken from us before his time. Clinton doesn't have such chances.<br><br>In fact, we may see him as the darkest way such a beloved president could have gone. Our president has become a sort of parody of what was that vigor of the fight to be the first on the moon brought back to our days and it's simply not sticking on anything but dresses anymore. There is no question why Gore and his wife flee him like a disease for being a president like Clinton is nothing anyone wants.<br><br>As he remains just a balloon of hot air that somehow break the polls whenever he is involved with charms some people describe as black magic, it shows just how our nation could fall to charismatic leader that don't real have anywhere to stand but for their own interest.<br><br>Clinton said he had a lot of fun being president, we just hope the mess he made wouldn't be as much of chore than his passion would make think.</p>`)

While the economy may be good, our place in the world is only threaten by just one strong yet manageable rival and we do not quite fear tomorrow, we suffer from a crisis of conscience where our daily lives feel shallow as more and more of the fabric of society is being ripped apart for a goal alien to us.<br><br>In those time, we need to find a message that unite us. If two decades ago Reagan animated the masses, another man must rise among the rank of American to bring it into a life that is not just an accumulation of days, weeks and years that precede death.

And we must!"<br><br>"Now, let’s look at the facts. Under President Gore, we’ve had the ‘Gore Recession’. Oh, excuse me, ‘the economic adjustment period’ as his buddies in the mainstream media call it. Gas prices? Through the roof! All because of his war on fossil fuels. The so-called ‘Information Superhighway’? More like the ‘Government Surveillance Highway’ with all these new internet regulations! And don’t even get me started on the ‘Gore-acle’ of foreign policy! North Korea still has nukes and we’re too busy apologizing to the frogs eaters for not signing enough climate treaties!"<br><br>"But here’s the good news, my friends. The American people are waking up! They’re tired of being told they can’t drive their cars, can’t turn their thermostats above 68 degrees, and can’t enjoy a good old-fashioned incandescent light bulb! The Republican Party is the only hope to restore sanity to this country. And who’s gonna lead us?

My pick for 2008 is Mike Huckabee."<br><br>"Now, I know some of you are saying, ‘Rush, what about Romney? What about McCain?’ Please. Romney gave us RomneyCare in Massachusetts, sounds an awful lot like GoreCare to me! And McCain? The man who teamed up with Kerry on climate change? No thanks! We need someone who embodies conservative values but also knows how to connect with real Americans, the folks who’ve been crushed by Gore’s green economy.’"<br><br>"I mean I'll keep it real. The democrats are never going to win that ellection. If that the case I think I'll ask to be run over by a fucking train.

It already warned us about what the Simpsons were becoming, but there was something more that was being tried that really had potential.<br><br>The Simpsons was always a show in the balance between cynicism and optimism, as the unconventional family broke many conventions of what children could see in modern cartoons. However, those transgressions weren't that novel anymore, so they tried to reach for a message. While the hopes to achieve the impossible would never fade, the fight to get it was what mattered and what made us human.<br><br.Whether it were side plots like Bart trying his best to get an A in sports just to show how he was better than Lisa before switching to doing it for himself, the fact he didn't get his wish with his C+ showed that his work had meant something after all.

What mattered was the connection, the way we understood each other.<br><br>Interviewer: At the time, same-sex marriage wasn’t legal nationwide, but you two entered into a civil union in 2001. How did that opportunity shape your relationship?<br><br>Harris: It was a milestone. We were fortunate to be in a time and place where we could formalize our commitment, even if it wasn’t called ‘marriage’ yet. That civil union was our way of saying, ‘This is real. This is forever.’<br><br>Matthew: It gave us legal protections, yes, but more than that—it gave us dignity. We weren’t just partners; we were recognized as a family.<br><br>Interviewer: Senator, you were a longtime advocate for civil rights. Did your personal journey with Matthew change your perspective on LGBTQ+ equality?<br><br>Harris: Absolutely. I had fought for justice for others, but living this love myself made the cause even more urgent. No one should have to justify who they love. Our story is proof that everyone deserves the chance to find happiness, at any age.<br><br>Matthew: And thanks to those who came before us—activists, lawmakers, everyday couples who fought for recognition—we got our chance. Now, we want that chance for others, too.<br><br>Interviewer: What would you say to older LGBTQ+ individuals who worry it’s ‘too late’ for love?<br><br>Harris: It’s never too late. Love doesn’t expire. If anything, with age, you appreciate it more deeply.<br><br>Matthew: And if a former U.S. Senator can fall for a guy 50 years his junior, trust me—anything’s possible.

Players still stole cars, ran from cops, and caused mayhem—but now, every shootout was a foam-dartillery frenzy.<br><br>Instead of capping rival gangsters with a 9mm, you ambushed them with a brightly colored NERF Maverick, landing critical hits with suction-cup darts. Drive-bys became drive-pews, with passengers leaning out windows, frantically pumping NERF Rapidstrikes while enemies dramatically clutched their chests and collapsed in a shower of harmless foam.<br><br>The police response was equally absurd. SWAT teams rolled up in riot gear, only to unleash a barrage of NERF Rival rounds. If you got "wanted stars," officers would chase you down and tag you with Elite darts until you surrendered—or ran out of "health" (which was just your dignity).<br><br>Surprisingly, critics loved it. "A satirical masterpiece," said one reviewer. "Finally, a game where crime is both fun and OSHA-compliant." Parents' groups, initially skeptical, were disarmed (literally) by the lack of real firearms, reminiscent of the use of lasers instead of real weapons in 80´s cartoons. Meanwhile, hardcore fans modded the game to add realistic gun sounds, only for the devs to patch it out—replacing bullet noises with squeaky toy sounds instead.<br><br>As such, as both version allowed for cross play between the two, the NERF version became almost as popular as the real deal, making some wonder if it’ll become the official version in violence adverse nations like Germany or state like California. Still, other wonder if that game isn’t just the best marketed cash grab in existence as it sold a mod to change weapons for the same price as the original game.</p>`)

Staring out at a sea of supporters sporting red MAGA hats, Trump basked in the all-but-certain triumph. “We’ve achieved the most incredible political thing,” Trump said. “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”<br><br>How Trump, 78, won re-election will be the stuff of history books, and already America’s choice can be traced to some key decisions. To Trump’s top aides, the thesis of the campaign could be summed up in a simple slogan: “Max out the men and hold the women.” That meant emphasizing the economy and immigration, which Trump did relentlessly. It meant diverting attention away from the chaos of his first term, the abortion bans he ushered in, and his assault on American democracy four years ago. It meant a campaign that rode the resentment of disenchanted voters and capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited.<br><br>(...)<br><br>The scale of his success was stunning. Trump carried North Carolina, flipped Georgia back to his column, and smashed through the Blue Wall. His campaign outperformed its goal of turning out men and holding women. Exit polls showed Trump winning large numbers of Latino men in key battleground states, improving his numbers with that group in Pennsylvania from 27% to 42%. Nationally, Trump's support among Latino men leaped from 36% to 54%. Trump also increased his share of voters without a college degree, gained ground with Black voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and held steady nationally with white women, shocking Democrats who had expected a post-Dobbs uprising. Among first-time voters, Trump boosted his support from 32% four years ago to a 54% majority.<br><br>The consequences may be historic. Trump has dominated American politics for nine years now, and after four years of his tumultuous presidency punctuated by an insurrection, the country chose to reinstall him. Trump campaigned on an authoritarian agenda that would upend America’s democratic norms, and he is already preparing to deliver on it: mass detention and deportations of migrants; revenge against political enemies via the justice system; deploying the military against his own civilians. How far he chooses to go with the power the public has handed him is a question that will shape the fate of the country.</p>

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
