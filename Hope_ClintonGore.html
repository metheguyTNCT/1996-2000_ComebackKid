Around, you could hear aides whisper quietly, some avoiding your gaze, others casting anxious glances in your direction. The party had started with cautious optimism. Sure, the economy had its ups and downs, and the Republicans had hammered you relentlessly on Whitewater and your personal scandals, but there had been hope. Now, that hope was gone.<br><br>The screen flickered with images of cheering crowds in Kansas, in Indiana, in Ohio—states that had been expected to lean Republican but had turned out in force for the GOP. The electoral map was painted a harsh red across the Midwest and much of the South, with only a few splashes of blue along the coasts and in Illinois. It didn’t matter how much he won by, it was still decisive enough to leave no doubt, at least in your own mind, that you were a failure. States that you won easily in ’92, flipped. The ''Third Way Democrat'' movement that you spearheaded seems to be permanently dead.<br><br>You rubbed your temple, trying to find some sort of moment for relaxation. The moments of triumph from four years ago seemed distant now. The young, energetic candidate who had promised to build a bridge to the 21st century was now a man weighed down by defeats and mistakes, real and perceived. You were confident, maybe too confident. You’d told yourself that the debates had gone well, that the voters cared more about jobs and health care than your personal life. But in the end, you weren’t been able to overcome the relentless drumbeat of Republican attacks or the weariness of an electorate ready for change.<br><br>Hillary sat beside you, her hand resting on your knee.

              <p> To nobody’s surprise, the oldest man ever elected president announced earlier today he would not seek a 2nd term, seeing as he would be an unprecedented 81 years old at the end of it. Dole’s term has been mediocre at best, currently sitting at a 46% approval rating. During his term, he passed the Tax Code Reform Act of 1997, which simplified tax codes while also providing a tax cut to middle class Americans.<br><br>Although he wasn’t Clinton-Gingrich level of relationship with Congress, they haven’t agreed on everything, mostly due to his push for entitlement reform, and Democrats in congress showed increased resistance and hostility towards President Dole’s attempts at welfare reform. The economy has made significant gains, and many consider Dole’s leadership ''steady yet boring.'' VP Kemp has began his own campaign for the White House, but is sure to face a heavy contest in the primaries, with big Republicans like Jeb Bush, John McCain, Steve Forbes and others heading potential competition.<br></p><br></p>`)

She’s opposed President Dole every step of the way, including being the loudest voice against his failed welfare reforms, and spearheading the Democratic gains in the midterms.<br><br>You see, Hillary isn’t like your average First Lady, she’s determined, she’s focused, she’s a fighter, and she thinks outside of the box. Even though she’s only been a Senator for two years, she already has what it takes to become our Commander-In-Chief, especially compared to the ineffective leadership we’ve seen under our current POTUS, who is thankfully not running again.<br><br>She also understands that the tech boom was the backbone of our economic recovery, and promises to keep investing in newer and brighter resources.<br><br>When Hillary runs for the Democratic Nomination, support her as much as you can, go from door to door getting people registered to make history.

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!

    {
        name: 'Bob Dole',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/5nL1HEB.png',
        description: 'Bob Dole is a former Senate Majority Leader, and a long-time U.S. Senator from Kansas, having served since 1969. After his run with President Gerald Ford in 1976 marked a pivitol moment in his career, Dole aims to finish the job he started and become president in 1996. Given the lack of notable party members running, Dole is very likely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Highly experienced in Washington, and well-respected among almost all factions of the Republicans. Will do well with the old and rural vote.',
        cons: '73 years old, would be oldest president inagurated. Almost 0 appeal to young voters. 3X loser, with loses in 1976, 1980, and 1988.',
        strategy: 'Emphasize your youth, tie Dole to the establishment and unpopular Republicans.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Steve Forbes',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/y6q3197.png',
        description: 'Steve Forbes is a businessman and the current Chairman of the Forbes magazine. He is the Grandson of the Forbes founder, B.C. Forbes. As a candidate in 1996, he has been able to play the outsider card, promising great Tax and Economic reform. Due to his lack in political noteriety however, he is unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Somewhat celebrity status. Outsider promising change. Will do well with the business and the wealthy, as well as Blue Collar workers.',
        cons: 'Almost no other policies besides economy. Very limited political and governmental experience. Hated by the establishment, will lose out on their vote. Very toxic campaign, easy to exploit.',
        strategy: 'Question him on issues besides economy, Tie him to oligarchs, and emphasize your experience as President.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Pat Buchanan',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/uA6LEaX.png',
        description: 'Pat Buchanan is a political commentator and radio personality. During the Reagan administration, Buchanan served as the Communications Director, yet was very critical of George Bush. Buchanan ran in 1992 on Populist rhetoric and extreme conservatism. Due to his lack of appeal, he is very unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Populist Rhetoric and Conservative beliefs that may hit the tone with Middle America. Will do solid in traditional Republican states',
        cons: 'Gaffes, some of his rhetoric bridges on Racism. Little appeal to anyone outside the South and Plain. Will preform horribly everywhere else.',
        strategy: 'Ignore him, focus on your own accomplishments. Attack him on his social positions, and come off as the unifier to his divider.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Lamar Alexander',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/NCUN4Qf.png',
        description: 'Lamar Alexander is a former Governor of Tennessee. During the Bush administration, Alexander served as Secretary of Education. He runs on heavy bipartisanship. Due to his lack of name recognition or charisma, he is very unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Fellow Southern Governor, might take away some of your support. Pragmatic solution maker. Background in education is sure to help with Rural voters.',
        cons: 'No Charisma or National recognition',
        strategy: 'Play down to his demographic by speaking more vocally on education, as you could easily sweep them up.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Phil Gramm',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/DYkb9Sz.png',
        description: 'Phil Gramm is the current U.S. Senator of Texas, serving since 1985. As a staunch supporter of budget reduction, Gramm has served on the Senate Budget Committee since 1989, and has pushed for bills aiming to reduce the deficit. Due to his lack of appeal with other groups, he is unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Strong track record on economic reforms and budget reform. Will do well with fiscal conservatives and buisnessmen.',
        cons: 'Does not have much appeal outside of fiscal conservatives.',
        strategy: 'Challenge him on other issues outside the economy. Depending on how the economy is, you can either play defense, or ignore the issue.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Arlen Specter',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/hARhX2E.png',
        description: 'Arlen Specter is the U.S. Senator of Pennsylvania. A known centrist, Specter has constantly had moderate positions on issues like Abortion, Gay rights, and Immigration. He was also formerly a Democrat, which certainly hurts his standing with the Republican base. Due to his lack of name recognition, he is unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'Appeals to centrists and moderates due to his social positions. Might take votes away from you in the Midwest as well.',
        cons: 'Many Republicans view him with uncertainty. Party may not be ready to back him.',
        strategy: 'Emphasize a more moderate image, though reclaiming the Midwest could prove difficult with NAFTA.'

        name: 'Pete Wilson',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/ZPQArJj.png',
        description: 'Pete Wilson is a former U.S. Senator and the current Governor of California. Most known for his controversial Immigration stances and his support of Proposition 187, Wilson inherited the worst Californian economy since the Great Depression. While Wilson has certainly built a national image of his own, his own state is growing from his ideology. He is unlikely to be nominated.',
        pros: 'May make the West Cost competitive, has a decent national image.',
        cons: 'Policies on Immigration and Proposition 187 may hinder his support.',
        strategy: 'Present a balanced approach to immigration and focus on economic successes.'
