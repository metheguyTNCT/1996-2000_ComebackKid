He may not have been the best candidate the Republicans could've thrown at you, but he certainly was one of the most honorable.<br><br>Talking to him on the phone, he sounded to be relieved to finally be able to throw it all behind him. In fact, it was quite a pleasant call. You joked that you wished you both had that kind of complicity back in Congress, he retorted that it's just how politics is done, and you didn't make it easier on yourself either. Maybe you could share a beer with him some day?<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you.

No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br>Phil’s speech was different.

As a public servant, he spoke on how their ought to be a continuous fight for their personal well-being. That American dream in the new millennium needed to be maintained. You can’t help but feel a little angry that <i>he,</i> of all people, is the one lecturing you like this.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes.

You knew you had done a great campaign, your opponent always on the backfoot. However, you didn't expect the result to be called for you in less than an hour!

Was this how they felt when they got their "Republican Revolution"?<br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding a man older than sliced bread to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br>Dole gave a short speech recognizing the result soon afterward. It's certain you won't see him much longer. He'd already announced his retirement from the senate, and this was the nail in the coffin for his life in public service. He may not have been the best candidate the Republicans could've thrown at you, but he certainly was one of the most honorable.<br><br>Talking to him on the phone, he sounded to be relieved to finally be able to throw it all behind him. In fact, it was quite a pleasant call. You joked that you wished you both had that kind of complicity back in Congress, he retorted that it's just how politics is done, and you didn't make it easier on yourself either. Maybe you could share a beer with him some day?<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

          <p>There was an expectation it would take at least a few hours for the results to trickle in and for you to be elected. You knew you had done a great campaign, your opponent always on the backfoot. However, you didn't expect the result to be called for you in less than an hour! Not everyone had even the time to come before people where already celebrating. A sea of blue, states that Republicans thought to be their safe havens since Nixon switching back to you. Maybe it will be enough to gain some control back of Congress. If this don't, nothing will after all! <br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding a Gulf War grifter who had no legs of his own to stand on to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br> The general held a post-election meeting as split as the coalition that supported his candidacy. Still, the mood was clear, ranging from disapointment to outright hate. He had everything to vainquish that hated president, over-promised and under-delivered. The hero of Iraq became a pariah. He would carry on his words under constant insults before finally vacating the premises.<br><br>The call was to the point, he assured you that he held no grudge in defeat and that he will continue to serve the nation and it's Commander-in-Chief faithfully. During the call, he brought something up that he'd never said in public, simply out of annoyance of hearing the word "race card." He thought all people of color had a good place to be in the nation, however there remains people that would only like to see them gone. The gap of color in the nation has not fully healed, and simple excellence won't ever satisfy those that simply refuse that you should exist. He asked you if you could make a vow, to support those in this country who don't have a voice. You say yes of course, and the call ends, both of you on good terms.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

            <p>There should have been an expectation. Instead, it became a countdown to the inevitable. You knew you had done a great campaign, dangling Buchanan as bait to the sharks of the public. What you didn’t expect was for him to be devoured completely. Streets were washed in a tsunami of blue, mirroring the map itself. The anchors gasped in shock. These weren’t just any old margins. No, this was beyond that. Before long, it stopped being a question of who would win, but what records this hillbilly could breach. An entire country is cheering your name.<br><br>And so there you were, a 50 state champion.<br><br>You owned the economy, pushed through policies otherwise unthinkable, united the conflict of a lifetime. All while the Grand Old Pushovers decided to front a complete lunatic as your adversary. You had done it all. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud of Florida sent straight into your face, it just didn’t matter. They couldn’t touch you at all.<br><br>Buchanan gave no concession speech. He didn’t have the right to. Not after he cemented himself as America’s biggest loser. You chuckle at the thought. He talked about so much game, that he was the one thing that could keep America free and now... Oh, the silence. Oh what a beautiful sound. He couldn’t even show his face again, let alone speak on his promises.<br><br>You didn't expect him to call. Nobody did. Instead, you would see the following days filled with interviews of weeping Buchanan supporters, with a hollow look to their souls, oscillating between the stages of grief. Betrayed by their savior and left to die in the wake of their beloathed. There was no hope for them, for their voice drowned and meaningless.<br><br>The crowd around you takes out the bottles, staffers toast you with champagne. Congratulations were thrown to the king, but there was one person missing beyond this.<br><br>Hillary should have been excited, really. You did this for the both of you, for her too. Yet, her subtle frown looks ever so out of place in the sea of celebration around you. She grips her glass, looking away and murmuring something to nobody in particular. It’s so frustrating. Unbearable even. So you go and kiss her, and all feels right again.<br><br>The want still lingers as the both of you awkwardly separate. So too does the will to do. It’s all good now. It’s all so good, don’t you feel it too? The stress of the campaign swirls into the excitement of domination, of victory. Four more years of this. Four cycles of the earth all belonging to ourselves. The world is your oyster, and this just scratches the surface. Education, expanded healthcare, hell, shoot for the moon, let’s reunite Korea!<br><br>You salute to the crowd, to the American people. We are not alone, and we will be united. This fight’s not over, the war has just begun.<br><br>On November 6th, you stood as not David, but as Jesus himself.<br><br>You had beaten the Goliath last time, wrangling all you could and coming out scared but proud. This time, the only thing you could hear was the crowd’s deafening screams. Their hands reached out trying to pierce your divine resurrection, their savior in the face of bigotry. They the followers kept faithful, they the followers became devoted. Despite everything you’ve done, they love you. They love you Bill.<br><br>Hillary, Tipper, and Al say their part, the latter joking about the number of times a vice president has been re-elected. As the Veep and his Second Lady walk past, Hillary, unusually quiet, holds your hand in silence. She gestures at the crowd before looking into your eyes.<br><br>“Congratulations Bill. I hope you’re happy.”<br><br>And then she lets go. A bitter hole caves in your heart. It’s no good. Just focus on the crowd.<br><br>This is your legacy after all, Hillary and Al will continue it after you. As they jeer and jump in excitement, the rush you so desperately seek floods back. Life is good again.<br><br>For once in your life, you are not discarded. For once in your life, you will be remembered.<br><br>Your legacy will live on forever.</p>

            <p> It's all over. The man they mockingly called Specter the Spectator in this very footrace has pulled ahead, and all the hard work, effort, and progress is gone. As the hours dragged by, you soon moved from the ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock to your ironically named Presidential Suite. You really thought this morning that you had it in the bag. Your staff comes by, staggering their way into your room, to see you glued to the television screen, occasionally rubbing your tired, tired eyes with your hand. <br><br> ''Arlen Specter has won Ohio,'' you hear that little newscaster with her vocal fry say through the television speakers. It’s not official yet, the chyron still flashes 'too close to call’ in many states, but the way she says it, flat, resigned, like even she knows what’s coming, tells you everything. You stare at the screen, and in your heart, you know it’s over. <br><br> You know you let them down tonight, and that's something you're going to be forced to live with.<br><br> And you will. Quietly. With the cameras gone and the crowds dispersed, you'll sit with that weight in silence, every morning darker, every evening a little more still. The calls will stop. The invitations will slow. The world will keep moving, and you'll be left behind: a man who almost was, or the man who had it, and lost it, fair and square. <br><br> For the first time in what feels like hours, you turn to Hillary. ''You tried really, really, really hard, Bill. We all did,'' she says, moving her hand to your shaking knee. ''It won't be in vain, you know that?'' she adds. It doesn't matter. You'll be Jimmy Carter 2 in the history books. <br><br> You take a deep breath, stand up, and finally speak. ''Get Arlen on the phone,'' you bark to your staff. They try and fight it—something about you still having a chance, technically—but you've always been practical. After a few unbearable moments, you get the maverick from Pennsylvania on the phone. He sounds shocked, but warm. Almost. The soon-to-be President-elect swears to you on a first-name basis that he will need to rely on your counsel in the coming years. You try your best to verbally nod, and hang up. <br><br> ''You don't have to address them tonight,'' Hillary says, referring to the crowd of folks downstairs. You shake your head, put on your suit jacket, grab the little scribbles of a concession speech from your pocket, and make your way on stage. You thank your supporters, friends, family, and even Arlen Specter, who you describe as a ''man of decency and good honor'' — someone your supporters shouldn't fear as President. <br><br> Soon it's over. As you leave the stage, the applause fading behind you, you can’t shake the feeling that your time in the spotlight has come to an end.<br></p>

          <p> It's all over. The man they mockingly called Specter the Spectator in this very footrace has pulled ahead, and all the hard work, effort, and progress is gone. As the hours dragged by, you soon moved from the ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock to your ironically named Presidential Suite. You really thought this morning that you had it in the bag. Your staff comes by, staggering their way into your room, to see you glued to the television screen, occasionally rubbing your tired, tired eyes with your hand. <br><br> ''Arlen Specter has won Ohio,'' you hear that little newscaster with her vocal fry say through the television speakers. It’s not official yet, the chyron still flashes 'too close to call’ in many states, but the way she says it, flat, resigned, like even she knows what’s coming, tells you everything. You stare at the screen, and in your heart, you know it’s over. <br><br> You know you let them down tonight, and that's something you're going to be forced to live with.<br><br> And you will. Quietly. With the cameras gone and the crowds dispersed, you'll sit with that weight in silence, every morning darker, every evening a little more still. The calls will stop. The invitations will slow. The world will keep moving, and you'll be left behind: a man who almost was, or the man who had it, and lost it, fair and square. <br><br> For the first time in what feels like hours, you turn to Hillary. ''You tried really, really, really hard, Bill. We all did,'' she says, moving her hand to your shaking knee. ''It won't be in vain, you know that?'' she adds. It doesn't matter. You'll be Jimmy Carter 2 in the history books. <br><br> You take a deep breath, stand up, and finally speak. ''Get Arlen on the phone,'' you bark to your staff. They try and fight it—something about you still having a chance, technically—but you've always been practical. After a few unbearable moments, you get the maverick from Pennsylvania on the phone. He sounds shocked, but warm. Almost. The soon-to-be President-elect swears to you on a first-name basis that he will need to rely on your counsel in the coming years. You try your best to verbally nod, and hang up. <br><br> ''You don't have to address them tonight,'' Hillary says, referring to the crowd of folks downstairs. You shake your head, put on your suit jacket, grab the little scribbles of a concession speech from your pocket, and make your way on stage. You thank your supporters, friends, family, and even Arlen Specter, who you describe as a ''man of decency and good honor'' — someone your supporters shouldn't fear as President. <br><br> Soon it's over. As you leave the stage, the applause fading behind you, you can’t shake the feeling that your time in the spotlight has come to an end.<br></p>

<p>The common belief is that these themed restaurants, the Rainforest Cafés, the Hard Rock Cafés, succeeded through sheer novelty.

A happy meal, a cheap toy, a playground. It was an ecosystem as finely balanced as any rainforest.</p>
<p>But then came a proposal from a man you probably do not know. A tax nerd named Steve Forbes. From his two hands, the left brought the flat tax we know, the other something much more destructive. A land tax.<br><br>Now, in his vision, this tax was not meant to be some sweeping reform. What passed was a pale shadow, a minor levy. But for a business model built on volume, on razor-thin margins and a vast, ubiquitous presence... it was enough.</p>
<p>(Frakes gestures to a star chart that materializes beside him, showing graphs and a golden arches logo slowly deflating.)</p>
<p>The McDonald's empire, stretching across countless properties, found its model unsustainable. To survive, they had to raise prices. And to protect profits, the quality... shifted. The fries became less consistent. The toys felt cheaper. The experience, once a reliable joy, began what your economists call... "begining to suck."</p>
<p>And so, the children were cast adrift. Their parents, seeking that same simple joy, found it not under the golden arches, but under the canopy of the Rainforest Café. They found it in the folksy, Canadian charm of a Tim Hortons. These new temples were ready. They were different, they were louder... But they where just as expensive, they were <i>there.</i></p>
<p>A multi-billion dollar shift in your reality's culinary landscape, triggered not by a grand plan, but by the unintended consequence of the smallest tax. A tiny pebble of policy that started an avalanche of animatronic gorillas and double-doubles.</p>

        <p>
<strong><em>SEGA’s throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>By <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hilary Goldstein</span></strong> <strong>| Posted: NOV, 19 2005 1:20 PM</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ll never forget my first day of school. I was about five years old, and I’d just been dropped off. I was terrified until I actually walked in the room, and my teacher, Mr. Stevenson, said welcome. He was a folksy guy, really nice to me, wore this tacky flannel shirt, gave me snacks and introduced me to every student! He made me feel welcomed the entire time I was there, and to this day remains my favorite teacher. 
</p>
<p>
When I fired up Sonic Adventure 2 four years ago, it was almost as if Mr. Stevenson himself had been cast to play Sonic’s main rival, Shadow. In contrast to Sonic’s cockyness and can-do attitude, Shadow was an overall problem solver who was understanding and patient. He even had flannel-padded shoes! Their banter remains some of my favorite in the series, and Shadow certainly made his mark as one of my favorite characters, due in part to him reminding me of Mr. Stevenson.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine Mr. Stevenson riding motorcycles with a gun killing aliens and trying to find that “damn fourth chaos emerald” in his iconic southern accent (real quote from the game by the way). That’s the Shadow! the Hedgehog solo game. Really off-putting, right? SEGA doesn’t seem to think so. Ever since they pulled out of console making, their heads are out of the game. It’s like when your friend downsizes and then loses their job, wife and has to sell their car.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Shadow’s Identity War</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Ignoring the obviously bad justification disguised as a plot device of Shadow having amnesia, he acts wildly out of character in this entry. The game ultimately comes down to the idea of good vs evil, yada yada yada, but what I’m really interested in is the gameplay choices.
</p>
<p>
Apparently, SEGA’s inspiration for Sonic was Bill Clinton, and it sure fits that Shadow’s was Lamar Alexander. Much like Shadow, Alexander started off as a southern charmer making solutions and problem solving, but ended up completely forgetting who he was during his term in office, figuratively speaking, and ended up being a big disappointment to the populist wing of the GOP, kind of like how this game disappointed me.
</p>
<p>
If you look at it this way, you have to ask why would SEGA parallel Shadow’s character growth to the IRL progression of the Alexander Administration? The gold line they created in SA2 must have been a fluke, much like Lamar winning a term to begin with. Just like his re-election prospects, this game flopped HARD.
</p>
<p>
Could you imagine SEGA making a game where Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails are doing anything other than running around? If Shadow is as fast as Sonic, why does he need a motorcycle? If he’s as strong as Sonic, why does he need a gun? I digress, back to the story. Through a series of allegiance switches and lore dumps caused by the amnesia, Shadow can encounter multiple endings within the game, none of which fitting the character we’ve only known for 2 games. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, Shadow can <em>kill</em> Dr. Eggman if he believes he’s a clone and wants to assert dominance over the other clones. Even if he thinks he’s a clone, Shadow should have the innate values to understand killing is wrong. So why does he do it? Why is Shadow suddenly some brutish figure who doesn’t care about if he kills or ruins lives? I guess Shadow thinks Eggman is as bad as the Department of Education!
</p>
<p>
In Sonic Adventure 2, Shadow tried to calm down as many people as possible after Gerald Robotnik’s broadcast aired and came to Sonic on saving the world, making the blue blur put his pride on a shelf. Shadow’s friendship with Amy was endearing, as she reminded him of Maria, and her love for Sonic, whether repulsive or not, was a massive reason as to why Shadow began questioning Eggman. If the current Shadow was in SA2, these moments being gone would’ve lost all nuance for Shadow, and he’d just fall into the background of Sonic’s already oversized cast, yet another parallel to Lamar.
</p>
<p>
<strong>VERDICT</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you loved Shadow’s character in Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Heroes, if you could stomach playing that, don’t buy this game. If anything, I would wait to see if SEGA makes more one-off mischaracterizations like these. If so, my money’s betting on a Mighty and Ray game written by Ken Penders where they go full-on Bonnie and Clyde, robbing banks, and they run into a canonized Scourge. At this point they might as well make the entirety of Archie canon with how ridiculous they’re getting.

<strong>In another show of his selective bi-partisanship, ex-president Specter publicly supports Harvey-Care </strong>
</p>
<p>
by Jack Brabham
</p>
<p>
Fox News: 15 February 2009
</p>
<p>
Back in 2001, I had hoped that Arlen Specter would go with the wind. The Judas that had convinced the flock to nominate him for president only to work for the Democrats. We thought that his unsuccessful turn-coating toward the Democrats and rejection by the family he came from in 2000 would have finally put his name to rest in the dusty history books only opened when we speak of the "presidential party switch amendment".
</p>
<p>
Yet it was not to be. Once more, coming out of the swamp of which he was born, the Republican-in-name only turned blue-blooded Democrat and came out of retirement to spew more of his noxious opinions. This time it's not about supporting the right to murder children, nor is it about further denial of the status of the United States as a Christian country. This time, Specter finally conceded that Soviet Healthcare was actually always fine.
</p>
<p>
We should have seen this coming. From the start, it was certain that Helms wouldn't be able to contain our ex-president's arch-liberal tendencies. A commitment to our foreign allies the democrats lacked was never going to be enough to seal away his venom. As the wolf in sheep's clothing, he massacred our victory once in 1996. Now, his honeyed words about the needs of the needy, of the obviousness of communistic healthcare, as he supports that euphemistically called "Americanized Canadian Healthcare plan", are going to ravage not only our economy, our enterprises, the livelihood of our population but the very spirit animating each American in their right to choose which healthcare they wish provided to them.
</p>
<p>
We've already seen some less determined legislators open the door to the idea of some more reform needed for healthcare. It's the right of any person to wish for better, but we are letting perfect become the enemy of good. Nobody who wishes to improve will truly settle for table scraps. All will want to have the best that can possibly be given. The person who brings forth this proposal that will change their lives will always drown the one that will help them marginally.
</p>
<p>
We won't reiterate our points on how this universal healthcare plan will break our barely recovering economy and dig a deficit hole that would undo all the careful balance President Cain had done in his two terms in office. However, the very notion that some in the party that claim to have America's moral interest at heart today are even suggesting kow-towing to the end of American values of free enterprise in healthcare shows that we are on the precipice of the end of democracy.
</p>
<p>
It won't happen in a dramatic show. The reds won't come with tanks to take the capitol building. There will come one law after the other. First they’ll elect their socialist president, then they’ll come to control our well-being. They will pry away our means to defend ourselves. They will control even our own thoughts. Before long, no resistance will be possible under this new communist dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
We must stop this now. This path cannot continue for the sanctity of our republic is at hand.

<p>
<strong>sportsillustrated.cnn.com</strong>
</p>
<p>
Greg Adams | Feb. 18th 2010
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wayne Gretzky was the great one, but was there anyone capable of dethroning him?</strong> Plenty have tried, few have gotten close. For years, only Mario Lemieux was a viable challenger, and even then he never got close. But who else could have done it?
</p>
<p>
Enter <strong>Alexander Ovechkin</strong>. Born on September 17th, 1985, he became known for his agile skating, clever play making, and devastating shooting. When a then teenager is able to go toe to toe with men years above his age, all while doing the little things that counts, <em>no wonder</em> agents were flocking to Ovechkin. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone’s familiar with the great expulsion of Soviet athletes on April 8th 1997. As part of a series of questionable legislation to quell “the domestic Soviet threat” president Colin Powell forced all Soviet nationals playing for American teams in the big four leagues to be forcibly deported. On June 17th, after months of legal pushback from the NHL with no end in sight, <strong>the league would never be the same. </strong>
</p>
<p>
On that day, the NHL publicly announced that until the government softened their restrictions, or said players renounced their citizenship, <strong><em>Soviets were temporarily barred from the NHL. </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
I cannot emphasize <em>enough</em> the impact this had on the NHL. Besides the <em>political implications</em> of mass deportation, star players like Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny, and the entire Russian 5 (Sergei Fedorov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov and Igor Larionov for those not in the know) had their primes wasted on a substanceless show of strength that never <strong>meaningfully</strong> did the thing it set out to do.
</p>
<p>
As a Black man himself, Powell should have known how his xenophobic policies capitalized on a wave of fear mongering and discrimination of ethnic Slavs in the US in the same way Jim Crow laws did for Black Americans. I will never forget when Jaromír Jágr, a Czech, was asked why he wasn’t deported too, simply because of his accent. 
</p>
<p>
All of the slavophobia culminated in the Canada/Soviet Republic of Russia face off at the 1997 world championships. In a display of utter depravity, Soviet spectators furious at Powell’s reigniting of the Cold War, singled out similarly Black Canadian Jarome Iginla, hurling the N-word every time he entered the ice. The Canadian team had enough after the 2nd half of the 2nd period, initiating a full on line brawl that sprawled out between the two teams. For 9 whole minutes. It’s only fitting that with the rebirth of the Soviets, so too would there be another Punch-up in Piestany, all warts attached. Anyways, enough of <em>my own </em>political opinions, <strong>back to the story. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Said temporary restriction stayed all the way until <em>2002</em>, when in anticipation for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, a new arrangement for Soviet athletes was finally brokered between the NHL and Powell’s vice Don Nickles. Soviet nationals were back on NHL ice, but with a catch. Any athlete, new and old, <strong>had to comply with visa restrictions and pass background checks for any state ties to the Soviet government</strong>, known for using star players as political propaganda machines. 
</p>
<p>
If they didn’t comply or pass, the only options left echoed the previous policy. <strong>Renounce citizenship, or say goodbye to any NHL dreams. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Between agent and government interviews, for its 2004 draft, the hockey world held its breath to see which team could have the fortune to draft a <strong>once in a lifetime opportunity.</strong> The Washington Capitals were gunning for Ovi. <em>The Washington Agencies had other plans.</em> It’s rumoured that things went south for the then 19 year old following a confrontation about the visitation clause. In an alleged altercation, the Soviet reportedly cursed at government interviewers for <em>“banning right to return to motherland (sic).”</em> His fate was sealed shortly afterwards. 
</p>
<p>
On May 23rd, 2004, the NHL made a press release that <strong>Alexander Ovechkin had failed security checks</strong>, and was <strong>no longer eligible</strong> for the 2004 entry level draft. 
</p>
<p>
With his expulsion, <strong>one of hockey’s greatest what ifs was born.</strong> The legend of Alexander Ovechkin, a great hypothetical that never truly sprung into fruition, limited by circumstances beyond his own. While the Soviets of the 80s never got close to setting foot in North America, one must wonder, had President Powell not expelled all Soviet players, or had Ovechkin complied with visa restrictions placed onto him, <em>would this story be different? </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>The facts speak for themselves.</strong> Even as one of the few international duels featuring Alexander the Great unfurls beneath our eyes in the form of the 2010 Olympics, it’s ever increasingly clear the comparisons to Mario Lemieux are more than well founded. Ovi reaches impossibly high scores and points in the KHL he’s made home, and helms a dominant multi-year gold streak at the world championships. Ovechkin makes plays left, right and centre, and who could forget his explosive shot that has goaltenders flinching every time he gets a whiff of the puck? 
</p>
<p>
I’d like to think if Ovi did make it, he does well. Exceptionally well. Perhaps he wins the franchise’s first cup or two, or even three while we’re at it. Maybe #32 for the Capitals breaks team records, or even <em>league records!</em> With his generational talent, his number would certainly be hung among the Caps rafters. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, things didn’t turn out that way. We can deliberate all we want about changing minute details for a want of a nail, but what is said is said, done is done, and just like Lemieux, <strong>Alexander Ovechkin will forever remain the great one that never was. </strong>

<p>
Spencer Ackerman
</p>
<p>
<i>
The infamy of the 43rd President rests eternally, beside that of history's worst mass murderers. A deeper shame attaches to the country that celebrates him.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Dick Cheney's passing is a time to remember. Not his bland performance as Secretary of Defense, not his mediocre time in the House, or not even the murder and rape of nations on an industrial scale he eagerly facilitated. No, instead it's a time for me to remember the 1970s, where a bloated alcoholic stumbled and bumbled his way into the halls of power. It was a time of Hunter Thompsons and Spiro Agnews, a time for rage and hate directed against evil, and the only dispute is what evil is.
</p>
<p>
In his obituary for President Nixon, Thompson said of Nixon: "(He) was an evil man -- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency." This is true of Dick Cheney. In his screeds across the nation, Spiro Agnew in Harrisburg described how "Neither the greedy nor the malicious but the self-righteous who are guilty of history's worst atrocities... evil cloaked in emotional causes is well disguised and undiscovered until it is too late... they pervert honest concerns into something sick and rancid... Their interest is personal, not moral. They are ideological eunuchs." That is true of Dick Cheney.
</p>
<p>
But where the jackbooted thug Agnew shrieked about ‘’National Masochism’’, Dick Cheney believed in national martyrdom. Not for himself, who impregnated his wife twice to dodge the draft, but for the ignorant men and women who believed their public servants had their best interests in mind. He believed that the poor shouldn't depend on welfare, because it created dependency and burdened the taxpayers, and the taxpayer would be far better off paying to kill people hundreds of miles away who posed no threat to them.
</p>
<p>
If you asked Dick Cheney if he wanted to create a safer nation for his lesbian daughter or a more violent world with slaughter and pillaging and rape, he would tell you that he is creating a safer nation by tearing up peace treaties and creating a thousand new Osama Bin Ladens. He would happily work under men like Ronald Reagan and George H.W Bush, who sat back and watched as gay men died in the streets, and happily shake hands with repugnant bigots like Pat Robertson or his Henrich Himmler John Sununu, in order to slaughter and pillage. 
</p>
<p>
It is tempting to call him heartless. But he wasn't. He was a true believer in dumping shit in the rivers and saving nations by killing their people, by re-creating World War Two and pissing on the "coalition of the willing", on supporting his gay daughter while partnering with a man who used her sexuality as a method of securing voter loyalty by demonising it. He wasn't heartless because after heart attack number 5, he managed to snag a heart on the transplant list in 2005. I wonder how many people died so this monster could enjoy 15 years of his legacy being verbally attacked by Joe Biden and Chris Christie, while practically upheld by the "adults in the room" as the only way of maintaining American credibility that he had worked tirelessly to destroy.
</p>
<p>
As a Black man himself, Powell should have known how his xenophobic policies capitalized on a wave of fear mongering and discrimination of ethnic Slavs in the US in the same way Jim Crow laws did for Black Americans. I will never forget when Jaromír Jágr, a Czech, was asked why he wasn’t deported too, simply because of his accent. 
</p>
<p>
And he wasn't metaphorically heartless either. True, he valued murder over his daughter, but to his old friends? The taxpayer shouldn't pay for things like retirement, healthcare, or health and safety standards enforcement. But to his old friends in the oil industry? To Haliburton? Crack open your wallet or go to prison, as is the typical social contract. He was a criminal. In a just world, he would have been given an electric chair, after his fat ass broke the noose they would use to put him to death. 
</p>
<p>
There is no hell deep, black and burning enough for this monster. It is tempting to recount May 19th, 2020 as a day of rare joy in difficult times, because it is a day that a demon returned to hell. But he died at peace, surrounded by loved ones, and soon to be fellated by a political establishment that pretended to hate him when they in truth were him. He and his merry band of Neo-Cons never faced justice beyond being unpopular for a few years.
</p>
<p>
He was filth. Unremarkable filth.

By Kirk McLean
</p>
<p>
Published 9:08 PM, September 9th, 2003
</p>
<p>
Our society today has been broken. There is no other way to put it. We have been consumed by a gaping, irreconcilable anger, engulfing our media and our art as would a maelstrom, a ship stranded out at sea. The cultural zeitgeist of our once great nation, over these past few years, has shifted into an interminable echo chamber of the same commercialized faux-cynicism repeated over and over again to a nauseating degree. Every day I find myself confronted with yet another false Moses, claiming to have found the answer to gun violence or homelessness or greed or capitalism or politics, all for it to just be, once more, nothing but vitriolic bile and sensationalist hyperbole disguised as a ‘realist’s interpretation of the truth’. All of this hate, however, and none of it truly in the face of the unchecked voracity of a power-hungry, callous corporate destruction of our public services and Democratic system.
</p>
<p>
That is why, in this environment, when one finds true artistic expression, it is euphoric. 
</p>
<p>
What I am referencing is the recent piece of political satire, ‘Letter Of A Lover’, which has been widely circulated online as of late. Within it is contained what may be one of the most earnestly blunt pieces of modern writing I have read this year. This is rageful in a sense. Yet it is rage with a purpose. One that does not claim to provide a solution. Only to critique that which stands in the way of one. 
</p>
<p>
The key dynamic of the piece, the relationship between the two Bills, is brilliant. Their love affair is used as a means by which to both highlight the failures of their administrations and to scathingly critique the two men, especially in their capacity as leaders. It is a torrid, broken affair; yet, much like in the story of genesis, the two are brought back to the forbidden fruit of their irresistible, corrosive love. 
</p>
<p>
However, one of the most intriguing parts of the work to me is the characterization.
</p>
<p>
The fact is, the character of Weld is portrayed in a manner simultaneously exaggerated and pointedly accurate. He is cowardly. He is wracked by a sense of despair. He is anxious. His stress and fear are projected outwards towards others, manifesting in a bumbling, emotional man, with a slightly pathetic disposition towards self-deprecation and insecurity. In truth, this image of Weld, as a man wracked not so much by wickedness, but rather weakness, may be more accurate than the portrait of a cold-hearted creature of political delinquency we see purported by the major pundits of what remains of legacy liberal media.
</p>
<p>
Whilst this is obviously written from the perspective of Weld early on in his tenure, it is clear that there is little that has changed in the man over these torrid past 6 years. Observe his response to the Columbine hostage crisis 5 years ago, and his reaction to the LA bombings only a month fresh in this nation’s scarred mind. In both cases, he floundered, equivocated and stalled in an increasingly deteriorating mental state, until pressured by advisors to launch a botched intervention costing the lives of hundreds of Americans. He did not federalize the California National Guard in an act of strength; rather, it was in a desperate attempt to escape the supreme feeling of inadequacy which aides describe Weld as having possessed ever since he entered the White House. His relationship with Bill brings no different ails.
</p>
<p>
Clinton’s character, in contrast, is presented as ambiguous in his moral constitution; he bears no defining mark of evil, and brings with him no great indicator of good. This was much the case throughout his Presidency, and, as he edges ever closer to the shrinking circles of power Weld now surrounds himself with, it has become clear that the spectre of this snake oil salesman will not be exorcised from the highest office in the land anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The recent press conference between Clinton and Weld should be only yet another stark indicator of how apt this piece is. Weld has not broken with Clinton or his failures in the slightest. He has continued cravenly on the blazing course of deconstructing the American social construct and remaking the American global order into a new machine of silent imperialism. Their personal friendship which has seemingly blossomed since the 1996 election should not be a surprise to anybody; the two men are both, in their own right, sickly embodiments of decadence and Western hubris. They find comfort and vindication in the fact that their broken status quo has a supporter in the form of the only type of person who matters to the political class; a fellow officeholder, acquainted to the struggles and mental contortion that come with the position.
</p>
<p>
I doubt that America, much like Weld, will ever escape the shadow of Clinton. The Democratic Party has collapsed into infighting after their calamity in the 2000 contingent election, all whilst under the thumb of a party apparatus still morbidly enamoured with the former President. The Reform Party is proving unable to sustain itself as a cohesive entity, even in the face of the encroaching ‘Uniparty’ they once warned of becomes an immanent reality. The newly formed ‘American Liberty Party’ offers no solution, its voice only melting into the violence and spite of the political scene. There seems to be no further respite for our current system.
</p>
<p>
But I digress. This is a review of a niche piece of writing online, not another one of those manifestos from a false prophet I so decried in the opening stages of this article. I will not encourage you to do anything further than read the original work in all its scathing beauty. And to the artistically inclined amongst you; if you still have a desire to rise above the noise, take notes. This is how one does it.

How did that opportunity shape your relationship?<br><br>Harris: It was a milestone. We were fortunate to be in a time and place where we could formalize our commitment, even if it wasn’t called ‘marriage’ yet. That civil union was our way of saying, ‘This is real. This is forever.’<br><br>Matthew: It gave us legal protections, yes, but more than that—it gave us dignity. We weren’t just partners; we were recognized as a family.<br><br>Interviewer: Senator, you were a longtime advocate for civil rights. Did your personal journey with Matthew change your perspective on LGBTQ+ equality?<br><br>Harris: Absolutely. I had fought for justice for others, but living this love myself made the cause even more urgent. No one should have to justify who they love. Our story is proof that everyone deserves the chance to find happiness, at any age.<br><br>Matthew: And thanks to those who came before us—activists, lawmakers, everyday couples who fought for recognition—we got our chance. Now, we want that chance for others, too.<br><br>Interviewer: What would you say to older LGBTQ+ individuals who worry it’s ‘too late’ for love?<br><br>Harris: It’s never too late.

While I can concede that the entry in the new century would be much harder if any of the planed planes hit their destination, the idea that they would destroy the WTC, the Pentagon, the White House and the Capitol seems just a bit far fetched. We know how effective security was against the Taliban, so how would they be able to "just walk in" with AK's and do their suicide mission?<br><br>But the most egregious part however, is the cynicism about American society. For the movie, it looks like the only thing America would have needed to become a paranoid hyper aggressive imperialistic state invading nations left and right would be one national tragedy. Once more, we know that America has been more and more involved out because of the terrorist threat, but the degree shown is just absurd.<br><br>Honestly, don't waste your time with that movie.

So, naturally, the system magically decides some people are just too dangerous to release—conveniently right around the time their labor becomes profitable.</li></ul><br><br>And here’s the real kicker: The U.S. incarcerates more people than China—a country with four times our population that literally runs re-education labor camps. That’s right—a communist dictatorship locks up fewer people than the 'Land of the Free.'<br><br>So congratulations, America! We may not be the most violent country, but we are the best at turning punishment into profit—because nothing screams ''freedom'' like a prison-industrial complex that never misses a chance to monetize human misery.<br><br>(Cut to a close up stare of John Oliver.)</p>`)

I kept my hold clear, hiding away but the tiniest part of my eyes to gaze upon a group of man that had dropped down nearby. I think I blinked at least a dozen time when I read the U and N on their helmet.<br><br>Could it be? After all this time, had help finally come? But memories flashed like lightning, the lies, the betrayals, the killers who had worn stolen uniforms before. My fingers dug into the bark of the tree, the rough edges biting into my skin. Trust no one. That was the rule that had kept me alive.<br><br>Yet something in their movements was different. They spoke in hushed tones, scanning the forest not with the hunger of hunters, but with the weariness of men searching for survivors. One of them knelt, pressing a finger into the mud, studying the earth as if it could tell him where the lost had gone.<br><br>Then, a voice, clear, foreign, speaking words I had almost forgotten held meaning. "Is anyone there? We’re here to help."<br><br>Help. The word echoed in my chest like a drum. But the scars on my body remembered what my mind wanted to forget. The last time I had stepped out from hiding, the world had burned.<br><br>I held my breath. The wind carried the scent of sweat and gun oil, but beneath it—something else. Hope.

        <p>Interviewer: ...but one of the questions that most caught me is that... You seemed baffled by the US government action toward Korea, especially it's détente phase. Why is that?<br><br>Kim Min-Ho: I've seen what détente had given us. I was still a child when the deal was sign, we lived on the border with China. I didn't really know or care much for anything political back then, but I remembered something about how the American government was giving "Tribute" or "Reparation" in fear and as punishment for their action in the war.<br><br>Interviewer: And you didn't see much of any of this help, yes?<br><br>Kim Min-Ho: I... One thing we did see was the promised heavy fuel aid. Has the long march been going on, the government had still enough instinct of survival to know that he had to save as much of its possible as possible if it's to not fade apart. Yet... It was always rationed as much as it could be even though I've read the aid where quite generous. I... I wonder today where the rest of the aid went.<br><br>Interviewer: You think the regime embezzled a lot of the aid, even if it was just fuel.<br><br>Kim Min-Ho: Of course it did. If it wasn't official, it could have been small official wanting a bit more cash, selling to a family that had a sick child or other similar story. In any case, when I began to look back on it. The long march was never walked by those in power.<br><br>Interviewer: Still, you won't argue that America should have just given nothing would you?<br><br>Kim Min-Ho: Of course not! It's simply that has much hopes America had to coax the Kim regime into being part of the rest of the world as it was the "end of history", the way they did it only bought them time, time they used to finish their nuclear weapon. Since, it's hold as never been more secure and when I first saw friends of mine disappear after parroting a complaint that had never affected him before, I knew I had to flee.</p>`)
