You could have hoped for even more blue states showing on that screen, but you didn't have to stay all night biting your nails to grasp your victory. There hadn’t been many doubts on you winning the election, now the hopes are that that victory will also translate to a victory downballot. <br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding a man older than sliced bread to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br>Dole gave a short speech recognizing the result soon afterward. It's certain you won't see him much longer. He'd already announced his retirement from the senate, and this was the nail in the coffin for his life in public service. He may not have been the best candidate the Republicans could've thrown at you, but he certainly was one of the most honorable.<br><br>Talking to him on the phone, he sounded to be relieved to finally be able to throw it all behind him. In fact, it was quite a pleasant call. You joked that you wished you both had that kind of complicity back in Congress, he retorted that it's just how politics is done, and you didn't make it easier on yourself either. Maybe you could share a beer with him some day?<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

          <p>And so, another one bites the dust. At the Excelsior Hotel, victory felt just as good the second time around. You could have hoped for even more blue states showing on that screen, but you didn't have to stay all night biting your nails to grasp your victory. There had been a few doubts on you winning the election, now the hopes are that that victory will also translate to a victory downballot. <br><br>Sure, you had the economy, and the Republicans didn't help themselves by fielding a Gulf War grifter who had no legs of his own to stand on to face you. Still, it meant something. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud flung in your face, you've beaten them a second time.  <br><br> The general held a post-election meeting as split as the coalition that supported his candidacy. There were all sorts of corners of the GOP present, the near fanatical supporters who tried to blame Powell's loss on anything between Don Nickles and racism, the moderates in the party, who were never really sold on him to begin with, and some particularly vile far-right nuts calling him a baby killer that had to be escorted out. He kept his calm to the end before leaving with dignity, his job remaining yet unfinished.<br><br>The call was to the point, he assured you that he held no grudge in defeat and that he will continue to serve the nation and it's Commander-in-Chief faithfully. During the call, he brought something up that he'd never said in public, simply out of annoyance of hearing the word "race card." He thought all people of color had a good place to be in the nation, however there remains people that would only like to see them gone. The gap of color in the nation has not fully healed, and simple excellence won't ever satisfy those that simply refuse that you should exist. He asked you if you could make a vow, to support those in this country who don't have a voice. You say yes of course, and the call ends, both of you on good terms.<br><br>As the crowd around you began taking out the bottles, Hillary toasting to 4 more years, you could feel your heart burn some while in the celebration. The want was there, and so was the will to do but even as the stress of the campaign faded, those of ruling swirled once again. You have so much more to do: the environment, the budget, healthcare, education… It dawns on you how much the fight was just beginning as you bit your lips and carried on out. You were not alone after all, and with a Veep and a wife like those, you may just have 4 better years than before! <br><br>On November 6, you could see the jubilant look in the crowd. It felt like in 1992, when you managed to take out Goliath, there was that same hopeful shine in their eyes. Even in 4 years of struggle, deadlock, and tension, they had kept their trust in you, they had kept the hope for a better tomorrow, and they entrusted it in you. As you joked with Hillary, Tipper, and Al, it felt different this time around. You had begun writing a story that was larger than yourself, one that would continue after you. <br></p>

            <p>There should have been an expectation. Instead, it became a countdown to the inevitable. You knew you had done a great campaign, dangling Buchanan as bait to the sharks of the public. What you didn’t expect was for him to be devoured completely. Streets were washed in a tsunami of blue, mirroring the map itself. The anchors gasped in shock. These weren’t just any old margins. No, this was beyond that. Before long, it stopped being a question of who would win, but what records this hillbilly could breach. An entire country is cheering your name.<br><br>And so there you were, a 50 state champion.<br><br>You owned the economy, pushed through policies otherwise unthinkable, united the conflict of a lifetime. All while the Grand Old Pushovers decided to front a complete lunatic as your adversary. You had done it all. No matter what's been happening, no matter the constant scandals, the character assassination attempts by the right, all the mud of Florida sent straight into your face, it just didn’t matter. They couldn’t touch you at all.<br><br>Buchanan gave no concession speech. He didn’t have the right to. Not after he cemented himself as America’s biggest loser. You chuckle at the thought. He talked about so much game, that he was the one thing that could keep America free and now... Oh, the silence. Oh what a beautiful sound. He couldn’t even show his face again, let alone speak on his promises.<br><br>You didn't expect him to call. Nobody did. Instead, you would see the following days filled with interviews of weeping Buchanan supporters, with a hollow look to their souls, oscillating between the stages of grief. Betrayed by their savior and left to die in the wake of their beloathed. There was no hope for them, for their voice drowned and meaningless.<br><br>The crowd around you takes out the bottles, staffers toast you with champagne. Congratulations were thrown to the king, but there was one person missing beyond this.<br><br>Hillary should have been excited, really. You did this for the both of you, for her too. Yet, her subtle frown looks ever so out of place in the sea of celebration around you. She grips her glass, looking away and murmuring something to nobody in particular. It’s so frustrating. Unbearable even. So you go and kiss her, and all feels right again.<br><br>The want still lingers as the both of you awkwardly separate. So too does the will to do. It’s all good now. It’s all so good, don’t you feel it too? The stress of the campaign swirls into the excitement of domination, of victory. Four more years of this. Four cycles of the earth all belonging to ourselves. The world is your oyster, and this just scratches the surface. Education, expanded healthcare, hell, shoot for the moon, let’s reunite Korea!<br><br>You salute to the crowd, to the American people. We are not alone, and we will be united. This fight’s not over, the war has just begun.<br><br>On November 6th, you stood as not David, but as Jesus himself.<br><br>You had beaten the Goliath last time, wrangling all you could and coming out scared but proud. This time, the only thing you could hear was the crowd’s deafening screams. Their hands reached out trying to pierce your divine resurrection, their savior in the face of bigotry. They the followers kept faithful, they the followers became devoted. Despite everything you’ve done, they love you. They love you Bill.<br><br>Hillary, Tipper, and Al say their part, the latter joking about the number of times a vice president has been re-elected. As the Veep and his Second Lady walk past, Hillary, unusually quiet, holds your hand in silence. She gestures at the crowd before looking into your eyes.<br><br>“Congratulations Bill. I hope you’re happy.”<br><br>And then she lets go. A bitter hole caves in your heart. It’s no good. Just focus on the crowd.<br><br>This is your legacy after all, Hillary and Al will continue it after you. As they jeer and jump in excitement, the rush you so desperately seek floods back. Life is good again.<br><br>For once in your life, you are not discarded. For once in your life, you will be remembered.<br><br>Your legacy will live on forever.</p>

            <p> It's all over. The man they mockingly called Specter the Spectator in this very footrace has pulled ahead, and all the hard work, effort, and progress is gone. As the hours dragged by, you soon moved from the ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock to your ironically named Presidential Suite. You really thought this morning that you had it in the bag. Your staff comes by, staggering their way into your room, to see you glued to the television screen, occasionally rubbing your tired, tired eyes with your hand. <br><br> ''Arlen Specter has won Ohio,'' you hear that little newscaster with her vocal fry say through the television speakers. It’s not official yet, the chyron still flashes 'too close to call’ in many states, but the way she says it, flat, resigned, like even she knows what’s coming, tells you everything. You stare at the screen, and in your heart, you know it’s over. <br><br> You know you let them down tonight, and that's something you're going to be forced to live with.<br><br> And you will. Quietly. With the cameras gone and the crowds dispersed, you'll sit with that weight in silence, every morning darker, every evening a little more still. The calls will stop. The invitations will slow. The world will keep moving, and you'll be left behind: a man who almost was, or the man who had it, and lost it, fair and square. <br><br> For the first time in what feels like hours, you turn to Hillary. ''You tried really, really, really hard, Bill. We all did,'' she says, moving her hand to your shaking knee. ''It won't be in vain, you know that?'' she adds. It doesn't matter. You'll be Jimmy Carter 2 in the history books. <br><br> You take a deep breath, stand up, and finally speak. ''Get Arlen on the phone,'' you bark to your staff. They try and fight it—something about you still having a chance, technically—but you've always been practical. After a few unbearable moments, you get the maverick from Pennsylvania on the phone. He sounds shocked, but warm. Almost. The soon-to-be President-elect swears to you on a first-name basis that he will need to rely on your counsel in the coming years. You try your best to verbally nod, and hang up. <br><br> ''You don't have to address them tonight,'' Hillary says, referring to the crowd of folks downstairs. You shake your head, put on your suit jacket, grab the little scribbles of a concession speech from your pocket, and make your way on stage. You thank your supporters, friends, family, and even Arlen Specter, who you describe as a ''man of decency and good honor'' — someone your supporters shouldn't fear as President. <br><br> Soon it's over. As you leave the stage, the applause fading behind you, you can’t shake the feeling that your time in the spotlight has come to an end.<br></p>

          <p> It's all over. The man they mockingly called Specter the Spectator in this very footrace has pulled ahead, and all the hard work, effort, and progress is gone. As the hours dragged by, you soon moved from the ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock to your ironically named Presidential Suite. You really thought this morning that you had it in the bag. Your staff comes by, staggering their way into your room, to see you glued to the television screen, occasionally rubbing your tired, tired eyes with your hand. <br><br> ''Arlen Specter has won Ohio,'' you hear that little newscaster with her vocal fry say through the television speakers. It’s not official yet, the chyron still flashes 'too close to call’ in many states, but the way she says it, flat, resigned, like even she knows what’s coming, tells you everything. You stare at the screen, and in your heart, you know it’s over. <br><br> You know you let them down tonight, and that's something you're going to be forced to live with.<br><br> And you will. Quietly. With the cameras gone and the crowds dispersed, you'll sit with that weight in silence, every morning darker, every evening a little more still. The calls will stop. The invitations will slow. The world will keep moving, and you'll be left behind: a man who almost was, or the man who had it, and lost it, fair and square. <br><br> For the first time in what feels like hours, you turn to Hillary. ''You tried really, really, really hard, Bill. We all did,'' she says, moving her hand to your shaking knee. ''It won't be in vain, you know that?'' she adds. It doesn't matter. You'll be Jimmy Carter 2 in the history books. <br><br> You take a deep breath, stand up, and finally speak. ''Get Arlen on the phone,'' you bark to your staff. They try and fight it—something about you still having a chance, technically—but you've always been practical. After a few unbearable moments, you get the maverick from Pennsylvania on the phone. He sounds shocked, but warm. Almost. The soon-to-be President-elect swears to you on a first-name basis that he will need to rely on your counsel in the coming years. You try your best to verbally nod, and hang up. <br><br> ''You don't have to address them tonight,'' Hillary says, referring to the crowd of folks downstairs. You shake your head, put on your suit jacket, grab the little scribbles of a concession speech from your pocket, and make your way on stage. You thank your supporters, friends, family, and even Arlen Specter, who you describe as a ''man of decency and good honor'' — someone your supporters shouldn't fear as President. <br><br> Soon it's over. As you leave the stage, the applause fading behind you, you can’t shake the feeling that your time in the spotlight has come to an end.<br></p>

Peter and Pat, on trial for warcrimes, being sentenced to a week of prison before coming back for another week of hijinks is just a perfect level of silliness.</p>`)

We don’t believe that feet on the ground will be required, but we’re willing to keep anything on the table. Talks with Finland, Czechia, Poland and Hungary are progressing well but of course we can't go into details on that. Uh,yes, you for CNN.<br><br>BLITZER: Is there any truth to the rumors that Ukraine is interested in joining NATO?<br><br>KEYES: Well I haven’t spoken with Mr. Kuchma. Ukraine has that declaration of sovereignty thing that says they can’t join power blocs or establish itself as a nuclear power, so if they want in they need to change that. You, NBC.<br><br>WALLACE: Has Prime Minister Blair confirmed his stance on possible NATO intervention?<br><br>KEYES: Well, the President made his case for this being defensive. If the Prime Minister doesn’t want to see reason, then that’s on him. Anyone else? No, not you. We have too many things to do than bicker with lying news like ABC. You, from Limbaugh.<br><br>SNOW: While what Russia is doing in Georgia is unconscionable, isn’t so much support for the state a betrayal of America First values?<br><br>KEYES: Of course not. That’s ridiculous. America First means we look out for America, and America is a christian nation. We have a duty and obligation to stand up Godlessness wherever it is.

It takes decades for historians to reach a consensus that’s widely agreed on. But valid secondary sources have made the case for there being a new party system<br><br>>>I disagree? While the Republicans haven’t entered the White House since Pat, it’s not like the actual coalitions have actually changed. It’s still rural and upper class white voting for Reps and minorities and suburban people voting for Dems.<br><br>>>>>No one is disputing that politics are different from the 1990s. But how is it specifically a New Party system?<br><br>>>>>>How can you even ask that? Numerous scholars have argued there’s been a total readjustment of politics. Do you even read Lichtman?</p>`)

The issue is that every voice needs to be heard. If voices aren't heard, those voices will find a way to be heard. Those voices we hear today have tried to speak to the Democratic and Republican parties respectively, but they were silent. They didn't respond. Now, those voices speak on their own, as it's the only way they could.<br><br>Interviewer: So, you're thinking it's because the two traditional parties have tacked to the center?<br><br>Obama: That's the million dollar question. I'll say it as an American, we saw that as long as the two party system lived, it evolved and swapped planks between eachother. The Democrats went from the party of confederates to the party of civil rights to the party of "maintaining the status quo." Same with Republicans! Going from Lincoln to the Southern Strategy and now the Forbes Model. Those two parties remain in motion that will soon be 20 years old. It's not that they've moderated themselves, it's that they've refused to change, to bring anything new to the table, that's what's driving them down.<br><br>Interviewer: That does sound like a bias coming from you, Senator.<br><br>Obama: I'm not gonna deny my bias, what I also can't deny is that it's the second time the electoral college was inadequate in finding ourselves a president. It only happened once at a time were all men still had wigs and were saying it's still something normal while we had long outgrown the way we allowed only white male landowners to vote. The electoral college is just old bones that finally need to be buried.<br><br>Interviewer: You think President Sanders will be able to push through such an amendment? Even with a Democratic Vice President, it would require votes from both Libertarians and some Republicans.<br><br>Obama: I think it's the only way forward. If it's not now that we break the seal, we'd only stave off the inevitable.</p><br></p>`)

How did it feel to go from fur to suits?<br><br>Sonny Bono: Well, let me tell ya, it’s a long way from singing "I Got You Babe" to signing bills into law! But honestly, it’s been an incredible journey. Mary and I never expected this, but we’ve always believed in public service. Whether it was in music, business, or politics, we’ve tried to bring common sense to the table.<br><br>Mary Bono: And common sense is exactly what people wanted in ’96. After years of partisan gridlock, voters were looking for someone outside the usual Washington mold. Sonny’s honesty and his success in turning Palm Springs around resonated with people.<br><br>Interviewer: Your campaign slogan was "A Little Bit of Bono Goes a Long Way." How did you transition from a lighthearted image to being taken seriously as Commander-in-Chief?<br><br>Sonny Bono: Hey, just because I wore a fur vest in the ’60s doesn’t mean I don’t understand budgets! Look, I knew people would have doubts, but we surround ourselves with smart, experienced advisors. And Mary here, she’s been my secret weapon.<br><br>Mary Bono: We made sure to focus on issues that mattered. In fact, whatever the journal has been saying, I feel like I'm doing my part as best as I could, for everyone.<br><br>Interviewer: Speaking of which, you said you wanted to break from the deadlock but the recent bills for gay rights recognition have been drawing the ire from both parties. Some are saying it's almost overtaking your commitment to the environment.<br><br>Sonny Bono: That park’s near and dear to my heart, literally, since I helped get it designated when I was in Congress. However, I think it won't come to the shock of anyone that as a singer, I've had my share of queers around me. Great people, people very dear to me, people that have suffered a lot just for being who they are and...<br><br>Mary Bono: It's about making a stand for people that deserve love. If we have to step on a few toes to do it, we'll do it. Being bi-partisan doesn't mean not having a spine.<br><br>Interviewer: Speaking of it, considering the coming midterms, depending on the result, how do you think you'll achieve your hopes considering the opposition to it?<br><br>Sonny Bono: Simple, politics is just like showbiz. You don’t get a hit record by only working with one kind of musician. You need collaboration. Same goes for governing. I’ve had Democrats and Republicans over for dinner and played a little piano… loosens everybody up.<br><br>Mary Bono: And let’s not forget the "Pizza Summit." When the government shutdown loomed last year, Sonny invited congressional leaders to the White House, ordered a bunch of pizzas, and said, "Nobody leaves till we fix this." It worked.<br><br>Interviewer: And you think it'll be sufficient? Some say you are more activist than executive.<br><br>Sonny Bono: Well, I must say that I miss wearing my sweaters. The suits are killing me. But seriously, the hardest part is the scrutiny. Every word gets dissected. As such, when you are trying to do anything good, people are thinking it's a ploy to come against civilization or some other insanity.

It's true that he showed himself quite the champion for women right as long as you don't ask nothing about his personal act against them much like Lennon, still, it remains confusing.<br><br>On the one hand, if a Republican would have done half of what he did, he would be smeared in oil and feathered but with Bill, it's like his actions give an even greater shine on him, as if just nothing would stick to him. No politician had ever been so embroiled in scandal, and yet find his supporters worshiping him like Jesus Christ and never break from him.<br><br>I think we can call it a cult. While he's running the nation of a cliff, the hippie virus, the left virus, whatever it is has completely subverted a massive part of our population, and now they're gushing about the slab of concrete called Al Gore just because he was his wingman.<br><br>We need to give a focus back on what's clear. Bill's a monster, he's dangerous for this nation, the fact he was reelected is a shame in itself, and the fact people still see him as such a Christ-like figure shows just how much we fell as a society. We cannot live in a nation embroiled in such cult for much longer. Tomorrow, it's vote or die.</p>`)

There's been a noticeable decline ever since that Skinner episode, and things just haven't been the same since. While it remains as ever a contentious subject among fans, I'll myself will always brandish "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" as one of the last great hurrahs of the franchise before it began to fall down.<br><br><br><br>Of course it's not perfect. The commentary on the schizophrenical ways of Congress to sponsor Homer's Backyard Collider, while fun, was forced a bit too much in the "Get it? It's funny because it's true! Don't you see just how good our political commentary is?" way. It already warned us about what the Simpsons were becoming, but there was something more that was being tried that really had potential.<br><br>The Simpsons was always a show in the balance between cynicism and optimism, as the unconventional family broke many conventions of what children could see in modern cartoons. However, those transgressions weren't that novel anymore, so they tried to reach for a message. While the hopes to achieve the impossible would never fade, the fight to get it was what mattered and what made us human.<br><br.Whether it were side plots like Bart trying his best to get an A in sports just to show how he was better than Lisa before switching to doing it for himself, the fact he didn't get his wish with his C+ showed that his work had meant something after all. If the Simpsons had kept that drive, we would have avoided that current complete freeze of all development in the Simpson cannon where nothing changes, that state of undeath we find today.<br><br>In a way, much like how the SSC ended up only helping the discovery of the Higgs Boson instead of being it's progenitor, that episode showed that even the greatest of failures can help us go forward, and that's a lesson we all can learn from.</p>`)

Did you ever imagine you’d find love again—and that it would be with a man?<br><br>Harris Wofford : Life has a way of surprising you. After losing my first wife, Clare, I thought my chapter on romance was closed. But then Matthew came into my life, and everything changed. Love doesn’t retire—it reinvents itself.<br><br>Matthew Charlton : And for me, meeting Harris was like finding a missing piece. Age didn’t matter. What mattered was the connection, the way we understood each other.<br><br>Interviewer: At the time, same-sex marriage wasn’t legal nationwide, but you two entered into a civil union in 2001. How did that opportunity shape your relationship?<br><br>Harris: It was a milestone. We were fortunate to be in a time and place where we could formalize our commitment, even if it wasn’t called ‘marriage’ yet. That civil union was our way of saying, ‘This is real. This is forever.’<br><br>Matthew: It gave us legal protections, yes, but more than that—it gave us dignity. We weren’t just partners; we were recognized as a family.<br><br>Interviewer: Senator, you were a longtime advocate for civil rights. Did your personal journey with Matthew change your perspective on LGBTQ+ equality?<br><br>Harris: Absolutely. I had fought for justice for others, but living this love myself made the cause even more urgent. No one should have to justify who they love. Our story is proof that everyone deserves the chance to find happiness, at any age.<br><br>Matthew: And thanks to those who came before us—activists, lawmakers, everyday couples who fought for recognition—we got our chance. Now, we want that chance for others, too.<br><br>Interviewer: What would you say to older LGBTQ+ individuals who worry it’s ‘too late’ for love?<br><br>Harris: It’s never too late. Love doesn’t expire. If anything, with age, you appreciate it more deeply.<br><br>Matthew: And if a former U.S. Senator can fall for a guy 50 years his junior, trust me—anything’s possible.

Players still stole cars, ran from cops, and caused mayhem—but now, every shootout was a foam-dartillery frenzy.<br><br>Instead of capping rival gangsters with a 9mm, you ambushed them with a brightly colored NERF Maverick, landing critical hits with suction-cup darts. Drive-bys became drive-pews, with passengers leaning out windows, frantically pumping NERF Rapidstrikes while enemies dramatically clutched their chests and collapsed in a shower of harmless foam.<br><br>The police response was equally absurd. SWAT teams rolled up in riot gear, only to unleash a barrage of NERF Rival rounds. If you got "wanted stars," officers would chase you down and tag you with Elite darts until you surrendered—or ran out of "health" (which was just your dignity).<br><br>Surprisingly, critics loved it. "A satirical masterpiece," said one reviewer. "Finally, a game where crime is both fun and OSHA-compliant." Parents' groups, initially skeptical, were disarmed (literally) by the lack of real firearms, reminiscent of the use of lasers instead of real weapons in 80´s cartoons. Meanwhile, hardcore fans modded the game to add realistic gun sounds, only for the devs to patch it out—replacing bullet noises with squeaky toy sounds instead.<br><br>As such, as both version allowed for cross play between the two, the NERF version became almost as popular as the real deal, making some wonder if it’ll become the official version in violence adverse nations like Germany or state like California. Still, other wonder if that game isn’t just the best marketed cash grab in existence as it sold a mod to change weapons for the same price as the original game.</p>`)

To that, I say that the same could have been said of Sony's console if it couldn't take advantage of Japanese Labor. Sure, a few laws here and there helped it get along, but there is only good coming from competition.<br><br>After all, the next few years are expected to be particularly grizzly. In a sort of echo to how the disbanding of AT&T led to a surge of innovation, The current four way race between Sony, Nintendo, Sega and Atari is certain only to bring us the best. After all, the only reason why the video game crashed happened was because the game industry was being controle by just one mega company. Now, we can only hope for the best in the industry.<br><br>There's been some talk of Nintendo having remorse over the failed collaboration with Sony, especially as their Nintendo 64 consoles will enter an already saturated market.

I think the main trouble the marketing department had was trying to push out the idea that "woooo, no one can understand the impact of it! It would change everything woooo!" which has always felt very patronizing. Still, if it were just that, it wouldn't be that bad of movie.<br><br>The problem is that it's just Titanic but with buildings. About a dramatized idea of what the second attack on the World Trade Center could have been. That movie managed the exploit of being overly dramatic and uncaring for the destruction at hand at the same time, very much in the wide view of repercussion, while also introducing a non sensical love story (which hurts me considering I love Nicolas Cage usually) and just the most absurd of messages.<br><br>The film is very cynical about America. While I can concede that the entry in the new century would be much harder if any of the planed planes hit their destination, the idea that they would destroy the WTC, the Pentagon, the White House and the Capitol seems just a bit far fetched. We know how effective security was against the Taliban, so how would they be able to "just walk in" with AK's and do their suicide mission?<br><br>But the most egregious part however, is the cynicism about American society. For the movie, it looks like the only thing America would have needed to become a paranoid hyper aggressive imperialistic state invading nations left and right would be one national tragedy. Once more, we know that America has been more and more involved out because of the terrorist threat, but the degree shown is just absurd.<br><br>Honestly, don't waste your time with that movie. It feel like a self indulgent nihilistic fest, use your time with literally anything else.</p>`)

His bread and butter is the call for a ''Flat Tax'', which although in itself is very popular, he doesn't talk about other policies. In order to get the nomination, Forbes needs to promise the change a liberal administration isn't giving."},

The former Governor and Secretary of Education has a lot of the same base as you, and finds himself in a similar position to you four short years ago. If Lamar wants to be the new face of the party, he'll need to paint himself as a new slice of conservatism."},
{img: "https://i.imgur.com/t8plVPA.png",name: "Phil Gramm",title: "TEXAS SENATOR",description: "If there were a man drowning in as much scandal as yourself, it would be Phil Gramm. The Texas Senator left the party a few short years ago, and ever since has tried to ''fight the good fight'' as the face of the religious right. Although his attempts have failed for the most part, he'll need to frame the election as an attack against religion if he wants to be nominated."},
{img: "https://i.imgur.com/v0PbV2H.png",name: "Arlen Specter",title: "PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR",description: "The moderate in this election, Specter's unique positions on abortion and other social issues may make Republicans unlikely to support him. If it were to happen, it would be a mass rebuke of a conservative administration."},
{img: "https://i.imgur.com/DvJ3WdF.png",name: "Pete Wilson",title: "GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA",description: "Governor of the biggest state in the union, Wilson's traction as a candidate is no shock. Building a ''tough on crime'' image, his candidacy could potentially cause a problem for you. If he wants to get nominated, the Republicans need to buy into the idea that America ''isn't safe enough.''"}

Hand picked by higher ups, Bill Weld is the perfect choice to restore trust in the party, much to the contempt of every conservative. But what other choice do they have?"},

Given the magnitude of his defeat, and how happy he seems in retirement, his seeking of a second term is incredibly unlikely, unless severe international and domestic destabilization forces his hand."},
