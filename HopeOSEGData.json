            "description": "<p>William Jefferson Clinton came from nowhere. From a house off Park Street in Hope, Arkansas, to the highest office in the land, his journey feels almost like a Hollywood script. To get here, he challenged conventions and broke traditions, often hand in hand with Hillary, branding himself as a ''New Democrat'', the antidote to the liberal losers of days gone by.</p> <p>He launched a crusade for change, not just against Republicans, but against the ossified politics of his own party. If he can lead the nation while staying true to these principles, re-election should be easy. But public opinion is fickle — every bit as slippery as his own charm. Even in these good times, the Big Dog must tread carefully to avoid being dragged into the mire of Washington, where the muck can swallow a man whole.</p>",

He has always aligned himself with what he believes to be best for the country, even if it meant straddling factions. The senator’s son, a Vietnam vet, has always cared more about duty than some silly label.  <p><p> When he was added to the ticket, pundits were baffled, two young Southern Democrats? Yet, alongside Slick Willy, he charmed the nation and helped usher in a new political era. Now, from his seat at the Naval Observatory, his role in the administration remains undefined. But one thing is clear: he is the natural heir apparent, and, like it or not, he will remain by his boss’s side. \n\n</p>",

He’s being pulled into the Whitewater abyss, and his entire reputation, his very being, is being slowly melted away. You quickly realize there's no way he's getting confirmed, and you drop him as fast as possible and end up appointing Janie Shores.",

They inform you of their plans: mandating insurance, forcing businesses to provide coverage for employees, and subsidizing those on the short end of the stick. It’s a rather moderate proposal, but they’re confident this is what can be passed with relative ease. You, staying true to Hillary’s dream, feel this proposal is too watered down to be called real ''reform.'' But at the same time, there’s the matter of getting something passed. They ask for your opinion, but they’ve already made it clear what they want to do. But you know best, don’t you, Slick? ",

By uniting America’s diverse strands, he built a broad coalition that carried him through the wreckage of recession and into the White House, toppling the once-unshakable George Bush. \n</p><p>Now he sits in the same office once held by his hero, John F. Kennedy. He looks out the window and remembers where, and why, he started: <b style=\"color:#4470F5; font-size: 15px;\">Hope</b>. The scandals, the pressure, the questions, they come with the territory. He’s learned that. But he understands the stakes now: to prove he’s not just the boy who made it out of Arkansas, but the man who can lead the free world, and change it.</p>",
